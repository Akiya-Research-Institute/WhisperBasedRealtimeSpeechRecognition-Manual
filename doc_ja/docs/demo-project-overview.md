    ??? Danger "End-User License Agreement"

        The demo software ("Software") includes the Unreal® Engine code and other code, materials, and information (the “Epic Materials”) from Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”).  
        The Software contains source code provided by NVIDIA Corporation.  

        1. You agree to use the Software only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this End-User License Agreement ("Agreement"), and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions.
        
        1. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Akiya Research Institute hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense to install and use the Software solely for  verification of its functionality.

        1. The Software is bundled with, or otherwise include or be distributed with, third party software licensed with separate legal notices or terms as may be described in proprietary notices accompanying the Software. If and to the extent there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and the license terms associated with the component, the license terms associated with the components control only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

        1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any portion of the Software.

        1. You may not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute, modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the Software.

        1. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any encryption, security, digital rights management or authentication mechanism in the Software.

        1. You may not use any portion of the Software in any manner that would cause it to become subject to an open source software license.

        1. You acknowledge that the Software as delivered is not tested or certified by NVIDIA and Akiya Research Institute for use in connection with any system. NVIDIA and Akiya Research Institute shall not be liable to you or any third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or damages arising from the use of the Software.

        1. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA, Akiya Research Institute and their affiliates, and their respective employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees and costs incident to establishing the right of indemnification) arising from the use of the Software.

        1. THE Software IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA AND AKIYA RESEARCH INSTITUTE “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA, AKIYA RESEARCH INSTITUTE AND ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.

        1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA, AKIYA RESEARCH INSTITUTE AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR THE COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE Software, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S, AKIYA RESEARCH INSTITUTE'S AND ITS AFFILIATES TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS LIMIT.  
        These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply regardless if NVIDIA, Akiya Research Institute or its affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and limitations of liability form an essential basis of the bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms, would be substantially different.

        1. All Epic Materials are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, “with all faults” and without warranty of any kind.  Akiya Research Institute, Epic, and Epic’s affiliates disclaim all warranties, conditions, common law duties, and representations (express, implied, oral, and written) with respect to the Epic Materials, including without limitation all express, implied, and statutory warranties and conditions of any kind, such as title, non-interference with your enjoyment, authority, non-infringement, merchantability, fitness or suitability for any purpose (whether or not Epic knows or has reason to know of any such purpose), system integration, accuracy or completeness, results, reasonable care, workmanlike effort, lack of negligence, and lack of viruses, whether alleged to arise under law, by reason of custom or usage in the trade, or by course of dealing.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Akiya Research Institute, Epic, and Epic’s affiliates make no warranty that (1) any of the Epic Materials will operate properly, including as integrated in the MocapForAll, (2) that the Epic Materials will meet your requirements, (3) that the operation of the Epic Materials will be uninterrupted, bug free, or error free in any or all circumstances, (4) that any defects in the Epic Materials can or will be corrected, (5) that the Epic Materials are or will be in compliance with a platform manufacturer’s rules or requirements, or (6) that a platform manufacturer has approved or will approve this MocapForAll, or will not revoke approval of this MocapForAll for any or no reason.  Any warranty against infringement that may be provided in Section 2-312 of the Uniform Commercial Code or in any other comparable statute is expressly disclaimed by Akiya Research Institute and Epic.  Akiya Research Institute, Epic, and Epic’s affiliates do not guarantee continuous, error-free, virus-free, or secure operation of or access to the Epic Materials.  This paragraph will apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. 

        1. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither Akiya Research Institute, Epic, Epic’s licensors, nor its or their affiliates, nor any of Akiya Research Institute’s or Epic’s service providers, shall be liable in any way for loss or damage of any kind resulting from the use or inability to use the Epic Materials or otherwise in connection with this agreement, including but not limited to loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure, or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.  In no event will Akiya Research Institute, Epic, Epic’s licensors, nor its or their affiliates, nor any of Akiya Research Institute’s or Epic’s service providers be liable for any loss of profits or any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, or any other damages arising out of or in connection with this agreement or the Epic Materials, or the delay or inability to use or lack of functionality of the Epic Materials, even in the event of Akiya Research Institute’s, Epic’s, or Epic’s affiliates’ fault, tort (including negligence), strict liability, indemnity, product liability, breach of contract, breach of warranty, or otherwise and even if Akiya Research Institute, Epic or Epic’s affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages.  These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.

        1. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, the liability of Akiya Research Institute, Epic, Epic’s licensors, its and their affiliates, and any of Akiya Research Institute’s or Epic’s service providers shall be limited to the full extent permitted by law.
