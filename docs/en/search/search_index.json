If you specify a short phrase, for example at , the phrase will be removed from all words (e.g. that becomes th ). Get results from On Speaking event and On Spoken event. On Speaking event gives intermidiate result while the user is still speaking. On Spoken event gives the final result after the user stops speaking. Warning Note that the end of the On Speaking result tends to be incorrect because the speech is abruptly cut off in the middle of the speech.
